Welcome to the skeleton project!

Before running the project, first set up the conda environment with the following command:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

and then 

`conda activate skeleton`

From here, you can run your scripts in order:

`./scripts/visualize_input.sh`

`./scripts/invert_skeleton_image.sh`

`./scripts/visualize_output.sh`
