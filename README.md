Welcome to the project skeleton! This project is an implementation of the codebase design that I introduced in my presentation, [Coding for Research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19yjcO6wJD2namfWpumbC7slPaODvTbNet_SnvM1RRXo/edit?usp=sharing).

I have added a few comments starting with #NOTE_\<X\>. These are areas where I want to elaborate on the design choice. Additionally, there is a #TODO comment, where you can practice extending
this codebase.

Before running the project, first create the conda environment with the following command:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

and then 

`conda activate skeleton`

From here, you can run your scripts in order:

`./scripts/visualize_input.sh`

`./scripts/invert_skeleton_image.sh`

`./scripts/visualize_output.sh`
